#0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

##Task 0: Linear search Implemented a function int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value); Utilized the linear search algorithm to find the index of a value in an array of integers. Ensured the function prints the values checked during the search process.

##Task 1: Binary search Developed a function int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value); Employed the binary search algorithm to find the index of a value in a sorted array of integers. Printed the array being searched at each step for clarity.

##Task 2 to Task 5: Big O Notations Provided the time and space complexities (worst case) for linear search, iterative linear search, binary search, and binary search's space complexity.

##Task 6: Big O #4 Analyzed and provided the space complexity of a given function/algorithm that allocates a 2D array.

##Task 7: Jump search Implemented a function int jump_search(int *array, size_t size, int value); Used the Jump search algorithm to find the index of a value in a sorted array of integers. Printed the values checked during the search process.

##Task 8: Big O #5 Determined the average case time complexity of a jump search in an array of size n, using the step = sqrt(n).

##Task 9: Interpolation search Developed a function int interpolation_search(int *array, size_t size, int value); Applied the Interpolation search algorithm to find the index of a value in a sorted array of integers. Printed the values checked during the search process.

##Task 10: Exponential search Implemented a function int exponential_search(int *array, size_t size, int value); Utilized the Exponential search algorithm to find the index of a value in a sorted array of integers. Printed the values checked and the subarrays during the search process.

##Task 11: Advanced binary search Developed a function int advanced_binary(int *array, size_t size, int value); Extended the binary search to return the index of the first occurrence of a value in a sorted array. Printed the array being searched at each step.

##Task 12: Jump search in a singly linked list Defined a data structure for a singly linked list (listint_t) and implemented a function listint_t *jump_list(listint_t *list, size_t size, int value); to perform Jump search on the linked list. Printed the values checked during the search process.

##Task 13: Linear search in a skip list Defined a data structure for a skip list (skiplist_t) and implemented a function skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value); to perform linear skip search. Printed the values checked during the search process.
